## Extracting links from a website

I use **puppeteer** to extract links from a website and **axios** to check their statuses.

To start the program, in command line, run:
 **npm i**, then
 **npm start https://example.com** 
Example:
**npm start https://aua.am/**
The default website is **https://hexometer.com/**.
